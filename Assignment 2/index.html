      <h1>Global Asylum Data</h1>
      <p>By Ethan Cheng</p>

      <br>
      <p>
        <strong>What is an Asylum Seeker?</strong> <br>
        An asylum-seeker is a person who has left their country and is seeking protection from persecution and serious human rights violations in another country, 
        but who hasnâ€™t yet been legally recognized as a refugee and is waiting to receive a decision on their asylum claim. Seeking asylum is a human right. 
        This means everyone should be allowed to enter another country to seek asylum.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h3>Global Number Of Asylum Applications</h3>
      <p>
        With many current global events, we try to look at how the status of immigration, and refuge has evolved in the last 2 decades. The following map shows the
        the number of refuge applicants per country, with a year slider to filter different years. At the end of 2019, there were approximately 4.2 million people 
        around the world waiting for a decision on their asylum claims.

        </div>
      </div>

      <br> 

      <p>
        Here we can see the links between countries. Each line in the following map represents people applying to enter another country, with a similiar year slider.
        The legend is also interactive and you can analyse the different origin countries of asylum seekers.

      <h3>Analysing Asylum Decisions Given To Applicants</h3>
      <p>
        Here we can see how many of each decision was given to an applicant current residing in a country. The following bar chart shows the top 10 countries 
        per each decision type. Now, we can visualise how many of a country's yearly applications are actually recognised or rejected etc. There are four decisions that
        can be given to an asylum application; these are recognised (application is granted), complementary protection (application is granted for those who cannot return to their
        home country), rejected decisions (application is rejected) and otherwise closed (application is closed for administrative reasons). The number of total decisions can also be 
        displayed with the most applications coming out of Iraq in 2020.
